## CMPE 597 HW1

# Description
In this project, CNN is implemented from scratch and compared with a CNN using pytorch library. The tests are done using MNIST database. Secondly, a simple neural network is used to classify a given dataset.

# How To Run
1- pip install requirements.txt\
2- jupyter notebook\
3- Run the desired notebook

# Notebooks
1- HW1_notebook.ipynb: all Q1 and Q2 implementations and results can be seen in this notebook\ 
2- Load_From_File.ipynb: User can upload weights and test it using pretrained weights\
3- CNN_With_LR_Scheduler.ipynb: This notebook is for a model trained with LR_Scheduler and saves the weights to files

# CNN_Class library
Implementations of CNN from scratch can be found in that python file
