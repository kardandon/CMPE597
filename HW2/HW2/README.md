# CMPE 597 HW2
## Description
In this project, VAE, GAN and WGAN are implemented using pytorch and trained with MNIST dataset\
to generate hand written digits

## How To use
- Install requirements\
pip install requirements.txt
- Get Data folder in current folder or change the FOLDER in notebooks to desired folder
- Run the notebook of the desired model\
GAN, VAE
- If using GAN change loss to "BCE" or "Wasserstein" to get the desired model
- User can just run the "load cells" at the end of the notebooks to generate images without training
- IS.ipynb calculated Inception Score
